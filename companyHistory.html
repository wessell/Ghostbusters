<! story of our founders>
<p> Georgina and George Georgeferd were the founding parents of the Georgina and George's Ghost 
Grabbers company in the 1700s. It was on a cold, windy night that Georgina became frightened by random 
sounds coming from an upstairs closet. George went to inspect the noise with <b><font color = "white">only a candlestick and funnel </font><b>
in hand. After seeing his first ghost and realizing how unequipped he was to take on this spirit, he knew 
something had to change. Thus, Georgina and George's Ghost Grabbers products began to develop.

<!continued story and product development>
For over 300 years, we have worked to create cheap, user friendly products to help you rid your home of 
unwanted company just as George did for Georgina many years ago. We have come a long way from 
the candlestick and the funnel as you'll see on our products catalog. Our first 3 products were designed by
Georgina and George themselves:

Each product has a special for everyone's special needs as they rid their homes. Some reasons people have
rid their homes:

During the 1980's, our products became so famous that Delphi Films approached us to make a fictional 
movie based off of the work that our technicians do each and every day. Take a look at our movie!
